# CSC120-FinalProject

## Deliverables:
 - Your final codebase
 - Your revised annotated architecture diagram
 - Design justification (including a brief discussion of at least one alternative you considered)

Why I chose this game: 
    I chose this design because it is obviously a place I know and making real life into a game is fun. (I love playing sims). My mind immediately went to this idea when the project was introduced, but I think making some kind of game for music would be cool. I think it would be similar in terms of earning points by practicing an instrument then getting to perform at different venues depending on points.

Why I made the game this way: 
    I used a coordinate system instead of an outside map design like Guava because it seemed more intuitive to me in terms of movement. I would have looked into it more if I had more time, but I didn't want to reinvent the wheel. 

 - A map of your game's layout (if applicable)
 - `cheatsheet.md`
 - Completed `rubric.md`
  
## Additional Reflection Questions
 - What was your **overall approach** to tackling this project?
    I think coding is fun, so I did the bulk of it in the few weeks before finals which was a good approach. I pretty much just had to work on little fixes and making things more concise during finals period which was helpful. In terms of the coding itself, I tried not to jump from class to class and instead just work in larger chunks to keep things more organized. 
 - What **new thing(s)** did you learn / figure out in completing this project?
    I learned more about what should go in and outside the gameActive loop. A lot of my struggles during the project were from putting the wrong methods or initializing objects in the wrong place which led to problems. 
 - Is there anything that you wish you had **implemented differently**?
    I wish I had at least tried to use the Guava map approach, but I do like my coordinate system that I created. 
 - If you had **unlimited time**, what additional features would you implement?
    I would make minigames at the places and make the places more specific and unique. I would want to be able to order things from the cafe and have money to use in the game. 
 - What was the most helpful **piece of feedback** you received while working on your project? Who gave it to you?
    I missed the first code review session and I did not get my feedback for the second one, but I think in class, working smarter not harder in terms of condensing code is very helpful. 
 - If you could go back in time and give your past self some **advice** about this project, what hints would you give?
    I would say it is better to make functions and have less code in the main file because otherwise, you will get confused and also waste time retyping. I ended up reducing the amount of code in the end after simplifying functions, but it would have been easier to do it from the beginning instead of being stubborn.
